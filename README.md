# TokiPonaMeanings

Toki Pona Meanings aims to be a game which uses the words of the constructed language toki pona. The language only has a vocabulary of ~120 words, so each word has multiple meanings. 
In the Toki Pona Meanings game the player get a combination of two (or more) toki pona words and then try to think of as many translations for these words in their target language as possible within a given time. 
After this time is up, players evaluate whether each others results are valid translations of the toki pona words or not. The player with most valid translations wins. 

To Do

Up to now, the game only exists as an idea. The following would be possible milestones for the game:

1. Have a working set of rules to play by, which deals with issues like syntax words, order of toki pona words, and guidelines as to what constitutes a valid translation.

2. Have a playable version of the game

3. Hook the game results up to a database, so that the translations users found can be used, for example as a dictionary, or as a help for future players.
